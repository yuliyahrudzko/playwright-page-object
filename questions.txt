Adding a baseURL
It is also recommended to specify the baseURL in the use:
{} section of your config, so that tests can use relative urls and you don't have to specify the full URL over and over again.

When using page.goto(), page.route(), page.waitForURL(), page.waitForRequest(), or page.waitForResponse() 
it takes the base URL in consideration by using the URL() constructor for building the corresponding URL.
